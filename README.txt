This is a Bad Apple video played by cubes on a html server using Aframe. 
Make sure that you run this code on a live server, else this wonâ€™t work. 
Activate the video by hovering with the white cursor over the red teleportation platform.
Feel free to walk around while the animation plays.
Sorry about the bad preformance, JS is not build these things.
Of course you can visit the site yourself: https://badappleaframe.web.app/
